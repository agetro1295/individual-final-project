# individual Project and Final Project
Individual Project Outline:
This project is a tutorial in how to webscrape data sets from the internet using python. For this specific project, I will be webscraping the following data sets: 
    1. A data set on the number of guns per capita for various countries around the world.
    2. The homocide rate per country around the world.
    3. Nominal GDP per country around the world.
 
After this data sets have been imported to python, I will clean the three data sets and merge them into one data set. I will then perform some EDA on this dataset to gain some insights on the relationship between the number or guns per capita of a nation and it's murder rate per 100,000 people.

Group Project Outline:
This project aims to create a model which predicts the price of an airline ticket from a particular chosen airport to various destinations within the United States. To do this we plan to do the following:
    1. Use the FlightScanner api to get data on ticket price and distance for various carriers travelling from LAX to various locations              in the U.S. To keep the data sets manageable, we will choose 66 different flights coming out of LAX and find the  prices for those            flights every week beginning January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020.
      2. Once we cleaned our data set, we will run different regression models on the data set. We will then procede to choose the best model       based on RMSE and accuracy scores.
      3. We will also perform EDA on the data set to get some insights on our flight data set.
